# Link Page Generator

This is a simple tool that helps you create a personal landing page with all your important links in one place. It works just like Linktree but runs entirely in your browser.

## Features

- **Profile Customization**: Add your name and a short bio.
- **Unlimited Links**: Add as many links as you need (Instagram, Twitter, Portfolio, etc.).
- **Instant Preview**: distinct editor and preview modes.
- **Responsive**: Looks good on mobile and desktop.

## How to use

1. Open `index.html` in any web browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox).
2. Enter your profile name and bio in the input fields.
3. Add your links by filling in the "Link Name" and "URL" boxes.
4. Click **+ Add Another Link** if you need more slots.
5. Click **✨ Generate Page** to see your finished profile.
6. If you need to make changes, click the **✏️ Edit** button at the bottom.

## Setup

No installation is needed. Since this builds with standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can just open the file to run it.
